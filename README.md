# bash_scripts
some bash scripts i wrote for everyday things
autoEmail  probably insecure but it sends an email that you write from terminal from your gmail of choice
batt  is a simple script that displays date time and battery status
install_list will install all the programs i want on my system
mks will make a script, insert a hashbang, change the permissions to make it executable and open it in nano
off will shutdown your computer
restart will reboot your computer
stopwatch is just a stopwatch
timer is a timer with adjustable counting speed, time limit, and an option to run any command when times up
everything else i thought was very self explanatory
